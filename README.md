An API for Dynamic Positional Board Games

	The idea is to create a positional game wherein the mechanism is 
	too complex to be understood.  For the game to be fun, players must 
	be able to develop heuristics that help them make sense of their choices.  
	
	Board is made of Node(s)
		  and Edge(s)
	      has Agent(s)
		  does update
			   which checks for input 
              
			   addEdge
